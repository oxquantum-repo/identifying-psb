There are 4 folders here:

```processed_data``` contains the extracted experimental data that was used in the paper. This is the easiest accessible.

```raw_data``` contains all data that was processed and put into ```processed_data```. It is a bit harder to navigate but has jupyter notebooks to guide you.

```trained_networks``` contains some of the networks that were trained. 

```training_results``` contains detailed information on the training and evaluation runs of the various conditions. For information on how to access them, see the Visualisation folder.
